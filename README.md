## NEO4J API PROJECT 

This repository is heavily inspired by Neo4j's course "Building Neo4j Applications with Go" (https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/app-go/).

Goal is to build an API that interacts with a Neo4j Aura instance. Based on the http route called and the query parameters passed on, different query matches are run and results returned. 

Used in the project are Neo4j's go package and built-in libraries such as "encoding/json" or "net/http".
